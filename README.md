# gotbot

An experimentation with the Slack Real Time API for creating a bot to track monthly expenses. The gotbot allows for simple inclusion of expenses in different categories, display of totals and plotting. 

Not yet in a release-ready shape, but hopefully soon.

Based on the work from Jamie Munro published <a href = https://code.tutsplus.com/articles/building-a-slack-bot-using-python--cms-29668>here</a>.
