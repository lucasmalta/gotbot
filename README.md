# gotbot

An experimentation with the Slack Real Time API for creating a bot to track monthly expenses. The gotbot allows for simple inclusion of expenses in different categories, display of totals with some filtering capability, listing of previous entries, and plotting. 

Expenses are stored as a pandas data frame. Categories and keywords which trigger them are stored as a json file.

Based on the work from Jamie Munro published <a href = https://code.tutsplus.com/articles/building-a-slack-bot-using-python--cms-29668>here</a>.
