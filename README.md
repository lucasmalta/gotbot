# gotbot

An experimentation with the Slack Real Time API for creating a bot to track monthly expenses. The gotbot allows for simple inclusion of expenses in different categories, display of totals with some filtering capability, listing of previous entries, and plotting. 

Based on the work from Jamie Munro published <a href = https://code.tutsplus.com/articles/building-a-slack-bot-using-python--cms-29668>here</a>.
